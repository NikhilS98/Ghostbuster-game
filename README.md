# Ghostbuster-game
A simple game built in java where you try to 'kill' as many ghosts as you can with the help of a rechargeable laser beam.
Each 'kill' gives u a point. Ghosts will try to chase you by moving towards your current position. 
So you have to keep moving away if you're gun is recharging. Ghosts are respawnable so the game won't end unless one of them catches you.

Controls: Left mouse click on any location on screen to move to that point. Right click on the ghosts to shoot them
